# 0.5.0 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0))

#### Most significant changes

* Drastically reduce size of output JS.
  * `fastOptJS` reduced by ~590k
  * `fullOptJS` reduced by ~140k

* Remove Scalaz as a dependency.

#### Other changes

* Allow decimal percentages in keyframe rules.
* Add negation to length & resolutions.
* Add division to length & resolutions.
* The following JS-only methods have been moved from the `ext-react` module to the `core` module.
  * `createStyleElement`
  * `installStyle`
  * `<style>.addToDocument()`
* There is now a compile-time check that `styleF` inputs are safe to be stored in a `Map` (which is (by default) what ScalaCss does under-the-hood).
  If you use `styleF` with custom data types, see the new section at the end of [Functional Styles](../features/stylef.md).
* Defaults no longer use PlatformJS to determine autoprefixing rules. By default, all prefixes will be generated.
  You can re-enable this in your own defaults if you want to keep using PlatformJS.
* Remove `scalacss.ext.CssReset`. It wasn't advertised and isn't appropriate here.
* Refactor to expose less internal API. Everything now lives in `scalacss.internal` with `scalacss._` being a curated list of exports.
* Upgrade dependencies:
  * Scala.JS 0.6.12.
  * Scalatags 0.6.0.
  * scalajs-react 0.11.1
  * scala-js-dom 0.9.1
* Update caniuse data to latest.


# 0.5.1 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1))

* Change object aliases in `Export` from `def` to `val` so inner content can be imported.
* Build for Scala 2.12.
* Upgrade dependencies:
  * Scala.JS 0.6.13.
  * Scalatags 0.6.2.
  * UnivEq 1.0.2.


# 0.5.3-RC1 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/compare/v0.5.1...v0.5.3-RC1))

(Skipping 0.5.2 due to botched release)

* `background-clip` now has type-safe DSL.
* `FontFace` names are now optional.
  When specified they are never modified and duplication is allowed.
  When not specified, they are given a unique name.
* Upgrade dependencies:
  * Scala.JS 0.6.14.
  * Scalatags 0.6.3.
  * Scalaz 7.2.9.

# 0.5.3 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/compare/v0.5.3-RC1...v0.5.3))

* `scalacss.Defaults` was broken in that it always pointed to dev settings and never chose prod settings.
  This has been deprecated and replaced with `scalacss.devOrProdDefaults`. Unfortunately you can no longer
  import its members directly and must instead, store it in a `val` somewhere in your project first.

  * Scala to 2.11.11 & 2.12.2.
  * Scala.JS 0.6.15.
  * Scalatags 0.6.5.

* Replace all instance of `Stream` with `List`, `Vector` or `Iterator`
